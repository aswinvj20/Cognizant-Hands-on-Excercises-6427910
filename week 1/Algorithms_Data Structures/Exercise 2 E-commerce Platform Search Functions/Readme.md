Big O notation is used to describe the time or space complexity of an algorithm as a function of input size n. 
1)It helps estimate how an algorithm scales. 
2)Ignores constants and lower-order terms. 
3)Focuses on worst-case performance.

Best case,Average case,Worst case for Searching: 
Linerar search:
Best Case:O(1) 
Aveage Case:O(n) 
Worst Case:O(n)

Binary Search:
Best Case:O(1)
Average Case:O(log n)
Worst Case:O(log n)

Analysis: 
Linear Search:
Using Linear Search for small and unsorted dataset.
Linear Search is simple but slower. 

Binary Search: 
Using Binary Search for sorted datasets or where performance is critical.
Binary search is faster but it needs the sorted data.
